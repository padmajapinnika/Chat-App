         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Get your Firebase configuration details (apiKey, authDomain, etc.)
   - Update the Firebase configuration in App.js with your values:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebasestorage.app",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
